Import your LinkedIn posts into a WordPress widget.

== Description ==

LinkedIn discontinued support for personalized RSS feeds in December 2013. 
This plugin imports posts by scraping your Author Post Activity page: https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/[author]. 
Posts are sanitized and saved to a new table in WordPress, preparing them for output into your widget. 
The widget can be positioned in sidebars or footers like any other feed.


**Boost the Traffic to your LinkedIn Posts**

* Industry Leaders using LinkedIn for their social or news broadcasts can direct their blog traffic back to LinkedIn. 
* Plugin can import LinkedIn posts from any number of authors.
* Separate widgets can be placed into the templates to show posts by one author, or all author posts sorted by newest.
